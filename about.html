                <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
                <p class="large-text">Every day, millions of dog owners fill their pet's water bowl without knowing what's actually in that water. Lead, chlorine, fluoride, nitrates—contaminants that can silently impact their dog's health over time.</p>
                <p class="large-text">We started DogBox because we believe dogs deserve better. They trust us completely, and that trust deserves clean, safe water.</p>

                    <h3>The Spark</h3>
                    <p>DogBox began when our founder, Bob Christopher, discovered elevated lead levels in his city's water supply. His immediate thought wasn't just about his family—it was about his dog, Max. If tap water posed risks to humans, what about our four-legged family members who drink it every day?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-card">
                    <div class="story-icon">🔬</div>
                    <h3>The Research</h3>
                    <p>We partnered with Dr. Maja Drozdz, a veterinarian specializing in canine nutrition and preventive care. Together, we dove into the science: how dogs metabolize contaminants differently than humans, why hydration quality matters as much as quantity, and what warning signs pet owners should watch for.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Mission Expands</h3>
                    <p>What started as a personal quest became a mission to help dog owners everywhere. Alexis Neil joined as co-founder, bringing operational expertise and a vision for building a community of informed, empowered pet parents. DogBox was born—not just as a website, but as a movement.</p>

                <h2>Our Core Mission</h2>
                <p class="mission-statement">To empower every dog owner with the knowledge, tools, and resources they need to provide their pets with clean, safe, and healthy water—because hydration is the foundation of canine wellness.</p>
                
                <div class="mission-expanded">
                    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                    <p>Dogs drink water multiple times a day. Over their lifetime, that's thousands of gallons. If that water contains even trace amounts of harmful contaminants—lead, arsenic, bacteria—the cumulative effect can be devastating. Kidney disease, digestive issues, weakened immunity, even cancer.</p>
                    <p>Yet most pet owners have no idea what's in their dog's water bowl. Municipal water reports are buried in technical jargon. Home testing kits are expensive. And when you Google "is tap water safe for dogs?" you get a thousand conflicting opinions.</p>
                    <p><strong>DogBox changes that.</strong> We translate complex water quality data into simple answers. We connect you with affordable solutions. We give you peace of mind.</p>

                <div class="mission-values">
                    <h3>Our Core Values</h3>

                        <div class="value-icon">🎯</div>
                        <h4>Transparency Above All</h4>
                        <p>We never hide behind vague claims or marketing speak. Our water quality data comes directly from EPA databases and verified municipal reports. If we don't know something, we say so. If there's uncertainty in the science, we acknowledge it.</p>

                        <p>Every product we recommend, every article we write, every feature we build starts with one question: "Is this best for the dog?" Not what's best for our bottom line. Not what's trendy. What keeps dogs healthy.</p>

                        <p>We believe informed pet owners make better decisions. That's why we don't just say "buy this filter"—we explain why your water needs filtering, which contaminants to worry about, and how to evaluate solutions yourself.</p>

                        <p>One pet owner checking their water quality is good. Millions doing it creates a movement. We're building a community where dog lovers share knowledge, support each other, and collectively raise the standard of pet care.</p>

                        <p>The pet industry is full of miracle cures and magical solutions. We trust research, not marketing. If a product works, we'll tell you why. If the science isn't there yet, we'll say that too.</p>
